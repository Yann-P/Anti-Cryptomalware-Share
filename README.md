### Purpose
This Anti-CryptoMalware-Share (XCS) project is a response
by DTU Environment to the extended attacks that have been
received from late 2015 in which cryptomalware is encrypting
user data, both on the local infected system, and the network
shares on which the department keeps its core data.

### How it works
The concept is the if you have a share that is fully writable
and auto-mounted by all employee systems it is likely to be
attacked.  This is consistent with all observed behaviour
of the malware that has been observed.

Anti-virus has been of some use in combatting this challenge,
but has not been a strong defence.  This mechanism provides
another way to:

* a) identify the user account and hostname of attacking systems
* b) notify relevant parties of this information
* c) provide a place of attack which causes no damage
* d) potentially slow the attack


*See the doc/ directory for further documentation.*
