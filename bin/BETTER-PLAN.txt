xcs should be a single script, possibly with a lib.

First argument is the action.  e.g


  xcs monitor

which would then call, via fork/exec

  xcs action

which would then call, via fork/exec

  xcs report

etc.

xcs monitor will daemonize and set alarms for the "check"
interval (10 sec, 30 sec, 1 min, 5 min whatever the config says)
and wake up to check at those points.  Any change detected is
then handed to 'xcs action' via a temporary preliminary report (?).
