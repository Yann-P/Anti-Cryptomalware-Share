Due to repeated crypto-ransomware attacks I/we need better
defences.  This project should create a network share
which is global read/write for all employees and should be
mounted automatically at a low letter (alphabetically),
say F:.

When a crypto ransomware attack occurs on the drive the
following people should be given the following information:

People: the person doing the attack and all of IT and
IT Security Responsible.

Information:

Username, IP address, hostname, date/time stamp, path
of file that was created/modified.

And a warning to the user to:

A: turn off their computer, and
B: bring it to IT immediately

The frequency of the messaging about the attack shall be
able to be controlled; e.g 1 per 30 minutes, 1 per hour etc.
